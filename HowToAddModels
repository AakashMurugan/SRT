In order to add a new function to the program, a number of steps must be taken to integrate it.  
Most likely you have an R script that runs independently. 
This needs to become a function. 
This function should take an input of some combination of FT, FC, or IF.
The function may name them whatever is appropriate but those are the variable that may be passed.
Any print statements will only print to the servers console, it will not appear in the webpage.
Same goes for plot statements or any other outputs. 
The function must return the N0 and Phi in an array in this order.
You may return initial guesses for N0 and Phi as the 3rd and 4th parameters in this array if desired.
source the file in server.R in the form source("filename.R")
Make the call to the function towards the top of server.R in the form GO_EM <- GO_EM_FT(FT)
copy the format of the if statements for the new model
add your model name and abbreviation to the selectInput in ui.R 
the model name and abbreviation must match between the server.R and ui.R
